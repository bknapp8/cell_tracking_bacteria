## MATLAB functions for generating single-cell trajectories from Morphometrics contours
### This requires generating a CONTOURS.mat file with > 1 frame from Morphometrics
Morphometrics can be downloaded here: https://simtk.org/projects/morphometrics

### Overview of cell tracking
This set of functions will search for frame-to-frame nearest neighbors, which are given the same cell identity if within a given pixel range. Each cell trajectory is then defined as a continuous nearest-neighbor path through frames. Trajectories are then filtered by length and then each contour's geometry (length, width, surface area, volume) is calculated. 

### Description of files:
1. frame2frame_RUNALL will run load the CONTOURS.mat file and run each frame2frame_X function to generate a final traj_totals data structure containing trajectories of cells, which contain all relevant contour-level data (coordinates, frame number, length, width, etc.)
2. frame2frame_0_rememptyfields removes empty contours from the contours structure, which can sometimes be generated by Morphometrics
3. frame2frame_1_makestruct generates a modified structure with frame-to-frame relational assignments for each contour.
4. frame2frame_2_maketraj creates trajectories
